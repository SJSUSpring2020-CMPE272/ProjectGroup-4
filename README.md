# ProjectGroup-4

1. Sentiment analysis using smart voice assistants:
  - Description: It isn't uncommon to see a person talk to a smart assistant and instruct it to play various digital media.
      If we were to rate smart assistants, we'd say they are classified in the "digital worker" category rather than the
      "digital friend" category. We plan to apply sentiment analysis over voice to enable smart assistants to graduate to the
      "digital friend" category. For example, the voice assistantwill greet you when you come back home. Depending on your
      reply, the voice assistant would be able to understand the mood using your tone as well as words. It will then play 
      a video or music that could help you improve your mood. Going further, it could even suggest you to take up an activity
      that you enjoy most!
  - Target Users: This project can be implemented by any smart assistant in the market. Hence, making every smart assistant
      user eligible to use this project.
  - Implementation/Technology Stack: We need to use the following technology stack to accomplish this project -
      - Speech Capture : Microphone
      - Speech-to-text : Python can be used for speech recognition
      - Sound editor : This is required to create a frequency map of the input speech.
      - Machine Learning : Python can be used to map frequency with text in order to train the machine.
      - User Interface : HTML,Javascript,CSS for creating a basic UI to demo the project.
      - Smart Assistant : Alexa/Google Mini for testing
     
2.  Intelligent drowsy driver detection:
# Approved
  - Description:  "Time is money". We often hear this in relevance with the fast paced 21st century life. This has meant
      that we use more cab/taxi services than ever before. The cab drivers end up doing longer work/drive hours to earn
      that much extra money. This ofen puts them through a lot of stress and results in a bad sleep schedule. Accidents
      happen due to lapse of concentration which are a result of drowsiness or sleep depravity. We aim to install a sensor
      which detects the "drowsiness" level of the driver and raise an alarm if it crosses threshold.
  - Target Users: This will mainly be useful for companies like Lyft, Uber, etc for providing extra security to their
      employees(drivers) as well as their customers(passengers). At the same time, a normal person may also use this for 
      increased safety while he/she drives.
  - Implementation/Technology Stack: We need to use the following technology stack to accomplish this project -
      - Video Camera : This must be capable of capturing the driver's face.
      - Image Map : Python deep learning library to create an image map from the video/image stream
      - Open CV : This is required to stream video camera data to code.
      - Machine Learning : Python's Keras library to train the machine.
      - Mini speaker : We will require this to trigger an alarm if "drowsiness" threshold is breached.
      
3.  Breast Cancer predictive algorithm:
  - Description: We aim to use IDC(Invasive Ductal Carcinoma) images to predict the possibility of a patient being diagnosed
      with breast cancer. We will be using image of microscopic structure of tissues for this predictive algorithm. IDC forms
      80% of the criterion for breast cancer diagnosis. This algorithm will also classify the breast cancer (if levels
      detected) as either "benign" or "malignant" cancer.
  - Target Users: This algorithm can be used by healthcare industry extensively. It can be made opensource to make it
      available for the layman to run self tests.
  - Implementation/Technology Stack:
      - Machine Learning : Python's Keras library to train the machine.
