- Project Flow:
  - Training data values are stored in haar_cascade_files
  - Data is sorted into 3 parts manually:
    - Front face
    - Left eye closed
    - Right eye closed
  - Based on the training data results, the live image stream generated by webcam
    is processed. If both eyes are closed, the counter increments. If at least one
    eye is open, counter decrements (but never drops below zero)

- Scope:
  - Ring and alarm on detecting drowsiness
  - Trigger an email notification to Cab company if drowsiness detected 3 times in a span of
    15 minutes
  - Create a mock function to slow down the car if drowsiness detected (IoT) integration

- Tests:
  - Test #1:
    - Model functions well in bright light or direct light on subject.
    - Model fails to detect blinks or closed eyes in lower light
